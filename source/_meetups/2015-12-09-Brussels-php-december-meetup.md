        abstract: > 
            From ReactPHP to Facebook Hack's Async implementation and many more, asynchronous programming has been a 'hot' topic lately. 
            But how well does async programming support work in PHP and what can you actually use it for in your projects ? 
            Let's look at some real-world use cases and how they leverage the power of async to do things you didn't know PHP could do.
