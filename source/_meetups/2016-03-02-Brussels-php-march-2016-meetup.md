            To ensure a consistent quality for your application during development process, it is key to set up automated testing and deployment tools. Using this kind of tools is the best way to detect and prevent application regression and to improve end user experience.            
            
            Use of these tools combined with Continuous Delivery and Deployment practices allows to update applications much faster and more frequently.
