            Join the Meetup with Percona to discuss how to get great MySQL performance while being practical - spending time on what gives you the best return.
                        
            The talk will cover the main areas for improving MySQL performance, pointing out the most important things you need to get right for each of them. Areas include:
            
                Hardware
                MySQL Configuration
                Schema and Queries

        content: MySQL and Openstack (Peter Boros)
        abstract: > 
            Like it or leave it, there's no disputing that MySQL is by far the most commonly used database in OpenStack deployments. 
            Most folks know that there are a number of different flavors of MySQL -- standard MySQL, MariaDb, Percona XtraDb, MySQL Galera, Percona XtraDb Cluster, etc. 
            However, there are a number of misconceptions and myths around the pros and cons of these flavors of MySQL. 
            In this talk, we hope to dispel some of these myths and give some clear information on what are the strengths and weaknesses of each of these flavors, 
            what pitfalls to avoid when migrating between them, and what architectural information to take into account 
            when planning your OpenStack MySQL database deployments. We will discuss replication topologies and techniques, 
            and explain how the Galera Cluster variants differ from standard MySQL replication, and demonstrate using pt-query-digest 
            to determine if a synchronously-replication database cluster like Percona XtraDb Cluster is a good fit for certain OpenStack projects.
