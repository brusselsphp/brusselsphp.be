            In this talk Frederick is going to prove he is more then just a pretty face!
            The talk will cover the basics of api design and will move on to more advanced topics like authentication and file uploads.
            The talk itself is based on his blogpost but will delve deeper into the topics discussed there.
            The talk is language agnostic, so even if you're into some obscure programming language you can still adapt the techniques discussed.

        abstract: | 
            Thanks to all the excellent resources on server management many developers are now setting up and administrating their own servers.
            If you are one of them you can't count on anybody else but yourself to backup the data of your clients.
            We'll cover the backup issues presented when using modern hosting such as Linode and DigitalOcean.
            Then we'll review some enterprise grade solutions.
            Finally we'll dive deep into implementing a backup system using Laravel 5's filesystem abstraction.
