        abstract: > 
            In this interactive talk I'll share with you a simple app I've been building on my spare time as a way of getting hands-on experience with Event Sourcing.
            I will show how I modelled my domain using DDD principles, how I applied Event Sourcing and CQRS using the Prooph framework, Doctrine and PostgreSQL, and how I hooked that up to Apigility to provide a RESTful API.
