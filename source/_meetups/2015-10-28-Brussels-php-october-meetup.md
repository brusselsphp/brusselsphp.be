        abstract: > 
            How is the Magento 2 architecture going to be relevant in today's rapidly-evolving PHP ecosystem? 
            This talk will not only provide a general overview of Magento 2's architecture, but also put it 
            face-to-face with the latest PHP development practices: like the use of Composer, unit 
            and functional testing, modular design, the PSRs, and more!
