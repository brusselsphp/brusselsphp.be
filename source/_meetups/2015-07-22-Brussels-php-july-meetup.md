            I am a Web developer working for madewithlove. I try to practise my speaking skills at meetups and conferences because I believe preparing a slide deck is the best way to thoroughly get to know a subject.

        content: Comparing Composer
        abstract: > 
            This talk compares composer with npm, bower, bundler, pip, berkshelf,… and their ecosystems of packages.
            Compared to these, composer is excelling with some pretty awesome features.
            I will focus on the great advantages of composer.
            Things like virtual packages, custom scripts, calling static methods straight from composer.json, the replaces keyword, …
            Stuff that most people don’t know about because they don’t always have to use it, but it could help them if they would know about it.
            At last I will tell about what the packagist ecosystem can learn from other ecosystems, and what package developers can do to further improve it to become a more healthy ecosystem.
