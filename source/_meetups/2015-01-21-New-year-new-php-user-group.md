        content: Talmudic Maxims to Maximize Your Growth as a Software Developer (Yitzchok Willroth)

        abstract: >
            You’ve been programming for a while now. You’re beginning to feel that you’ve got a handle on things but 
            at the same time can’t escape the feeling that you’ve somehow plateaued in your growth as a software 
            developer. In this talk Yitzchok, a rabbinic scholar and software developer, shares the 
            “wisdom of the sages” as practical, actionable advice – strategies and tactics – that you can use 
            to reinvigorate your growth as a software developer.
